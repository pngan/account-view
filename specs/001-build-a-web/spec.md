# Feature Specification: Personal Finance and Budgeting Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-web`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a web application that can help users to review personal bank transactions for the purposes of budgeting and tracking personal income and expenses. The data will be downloaded on demand from NZ banks using a bank feed proxy service called akahu.nz. Categories are to be autogenerated, and bank transactions are to be auto categorized. I should be able to peruse the categories and manually tweak the list of categories. I should be able to recategorize bank transactions and the system should learn from the categories. The categories are Necessities are groceries, kids activities, petrol, insurance, rates Leisure for things we don‚Äôt need but have allocated for our hobbies, self care, clothes, dining out etc. Maybes are maybes- not every month, but creep up randomly - like vet visits, gifts, medical expenses. Recurring are things like dog food, gas, haircuts- not every month but always need them every now and then. Autopay for all fixed monthly expenses such as insurance, rates,"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to connect my bank account to a web application that will automatically download and categorize my transactions, allowing me to review my spending, track my income and expenses, and manage my budget effectively. Data is shown in list, bar chart, and line chart views.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has connected their bank account, **When** they log in, **Then** they should see a dashboard with their latest transactions automatically categorized.
2. **Given** a transaction is incorrectly categorized, **When** the user manually re-categorizes it, **Then** the system should learn from the correction for future categorizations.
3. **Given** a user wants to manage their budget, **When** they navigate to the categories page, **Then** they should be able to add, edit, or delete expense categories.
4. **Given** a transaction is selected, **When** the user attaches an image (e.g., a receipt), **Then** the image should be associated with the transaction and viewable later.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the connection to the bank feed service (akahu.nz) is unavailable?
- How does the system handle duplicate transactions?
- What happens if a user revokes access to their bank account?
